## Why?

Want to use the command line just like in your shell? This is a better command line for you.

You can type the first few letters of a command and use the up and down arrow keys to navigate
through your command history.

- Clone the repository
- Change `minecraft_version`, `yarn_mappings`, and `loader_version` in `gradle.properties` to the
  version of Minecraft you want to build for
